## 📌 About

- A social media platform aimed to capture the essence of all popular, existing social media platforms 👑
- UI Design is centered around Pinterest. 
- With time, the best features from Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest will be added ⌚

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

-  Designed with the initial purpose of learning all the important CS development topics. I figured that the best way to learn React and backend tech would be to implement already existing (and popular) features from existing social media giants. This way, I have a blueprint of what I want to achieve 💪🏻
-  Now that I know my way around said tech-stack, future roadmap would be to slowly integrate other popular features (with a twist) + my own ideas bit-by-bit. That's what this project is for 🛣️
-  **Not a commercial product...yet**
